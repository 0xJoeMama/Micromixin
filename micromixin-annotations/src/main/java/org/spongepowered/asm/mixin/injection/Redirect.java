/**
 * The {@link Redirect} annotation redirects a method call to the mixin implementation.
 * The method on whom the annotation is applied is referenced within the micromixin documentation as the redirect handler.
 *
 * <h2>Handler signature and arguments</h2>
 * The redirect handler must consume all arguments of the redirected method in the order they appear within the
 * redirected method. In case the redirected method is not static, the redirect handler must also consume the instance type
 * of the owner of the redirected method at the first position. If the redirected method returns a value, 
 *
 * <p>The redirect handler must be static regardless of the static-ness of the redirected method. As a logical consequence
 * the redirect handler must also be private.
 * These steps are required as {@link Redirect} does not modify the stack and replaces a single instruction
 * with another single instruction.
 *
  <p>Locals and argument capture is not supported when using {@link Redirect}.
 *
 * <h2>Field redirects</h2>
 * Aside from redirecting methods which is the main use of this annotation, {@link Redirect} is also capable of redirecting
 * read as well as write references to fields - static or not. However, this is not yet supported within micromixin at
 * the point of writing (28th of January 2024). Regardless, the signature of the handler would behave much as if the GETFIELD,
 * GETSTATIC, PUTFIELD or PUTSTATIC were replaced with appropriate getter or setter methods. The integrity of the
 * operand stack must be preserved.
 *
 * <h2>Array access redirects</h2>
 * Furthermore {@link Redirect} is capable of redirecting array accesses via the xALOAD and xASTORE opcode families.
 * Like field access redirects, this is also not yet implemented in micromixin at the point of writing (28th of January 2024).
 *
 * <p>When redirecting read access to an array of type <code>{type}</code>, the signature of the redirect handler is as
 * follows: <code>private static {type} handlerName({type}[] array, int index)</code>. Likewise write access would have
 * following signature: <code>private static void handlerName({type}[] array, int index, {type} element)</code>.

     * {@link #expect()} as otherwise the injector might accidentally not match anything with no way of knowing
     * what exactly went wrong.
     *
     * <p>The following are all valid formats of explicit target selectors:
     *
     * <ul>
     *  <li><code>targetMethod</code></li>

     * <p>The parts of the explicit target selector (owner, name, descriptor) must always have the same order,

     * <p>It is generally recommended to not be lazy when it comes to explicit selectors,
     * the more information is provided the better. Information that is not supplied is comparable
     * to a wildcard - the first matching method will be targeted, even if nonsense.
     * It is especially not recommended to discard the method name, even if that is theoretically valid.
     *
     * <p>The spongeian implementation also supports schemes other than the explicit selectors.
     * However the Micromixin implementation only supports explicit selectors as documented above.
     * Where as the spongeian implementation supports quantifiers in explicit selectors,
     * Micromixin does not support them (yet). As such, quantifiers are not included in the documentation.
     *
